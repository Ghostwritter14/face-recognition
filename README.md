# What is this project about?
This is a simple facial recognition program utilising the power of deep learning. The libraries used here are opencv and face_recognition and pickle. 

To run this programme please create a directory with a subdirectory (should contain your name) within the directory of the python files.

It is important that the subdirectory is named against the name of the person you would want the program to recognise.
